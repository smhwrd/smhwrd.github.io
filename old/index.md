# Freelance Sound Designer for Film and Interactive Media

Hello, I'm Simon. I'm a Sound Designer and Audio Engineer based in Glasgow, Scotland. I like to think that sound is the glue that connects an audience to a screen.  It can bring people closer to a narrative and can establish contexts and emotions beyond the focus of the camera. I try to embrace this in my work by exploiting all that sound can offer.

I've previously worked various audio-visual projects including films, installations and video-games, filling roles as sound recordist, foley artist, editor, mixer, and audio programmer.

While I enjoy working as a freelance sound designer for film and animation, I'm particularly interested in working with interactive systems and video-games. Currently, I'm exploring this side of things by developing my own narrative sound based game using Unity 3D. 



I'm always open to discussing new projects and potential job offers so please get in touch if you have any questions
